                <p>
                    It is common for abusive men to use children and child contact as a method of control. They might
                    try to turn the children against you, or make threats to hurt them or take them away from you. This
                    can continue long after a woman has left her partner.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    You are not alone. There is support available for women and their children. Below, you can read
                    responses to some of the common worries women share with us. You can contact us so we can talk
                    through your options and connect you with specialist services. You can also seek advice from a
                    family law solicitor. Try to find one with experience in domestic abuse.
                </p><br>


                <p>
                    It is important to remember that children are very resilient. With support, they can overcome the
                    trauma of witnessing or experiencing abuse, and go on to live safe, happy lives. Below, you can find
                    some guidance on how you can support your child to understand what is going on.

                                                <li>You or your ex can apply to the family court for a Child
                                                    Arrangements Order. This is a court order that sets out who your
                                                    children live with and where and how much time your child spends
                                                    with your ex. It can also set out other types of contact, such as
                                                    through calls, FaceTime or letters.</li>
                                                <li>The court’s decision will be based on what they think is best for
                                                    the child. Where there has been abuse, the court must consider a
                                                    range of factors before deciding on the appropriate level of contact
                                                    for your ex. For example the court might grant reduced, restricted
                                                    or perhaps supervised contact in some cases. Or the court might say
                                                    your ex can only see the children in a Child Contact Centre (more
                                                    below). The order can also ensure that arrangements for drop-off and
                                                    collection will minimise possible contact with your ex.</li>

                                                <li>As part of the court proceedings, the judge is likely to request
                                                    that Cafcass (Children and Family Court Advisory and Support
                                                    Service) prepares a report. It is their job to safeguard and promote
                                                    the welfare of children going through the family justice system. The
                                                    Cafcass officer will probably visit you, your ex and the children,
                                                    then write a report and make recommendations to the court. Make sure
                                                    Cafcass is aware of your ex’s behaviour at the earliest possible
                                                    opportunity, and any concerns you have about his contact with your
                                                    children.</li>
                                                <li>The Cafcass officer will prepare their report with reference to the
                                                    ‘welfare checklist’, which shows the things they will be considering
                                                    when they make a recommendation to the court. The factors include:
                                                    (1) the wishes and feelings of the child (2) physical, emotional and
                                                    educational needs of the child (3) the likely effect on a child of
                                                    any change in their circumstances (4) the child’s age, sex,
                                                    background and any relevant characteristics; (5) Any harm which he
                                                    has suffered or is at risk of suffering (6) how capable both parents
                                                    are of meeting the child’s needs and (7) the range of powers
                                                    available to the court.</li>
                                                <li>If domestic abuse is raised as an issue during the court hearing,
                                                    the judge must refer to ‘Practice Direction 12J’, which is part of
                                                    the Family Procedure Rules. If your ex denies any allegations of
                                                    domestic abuse, then the court will probably want to hear all of the
                                                    evidence from both sides and decide whether they believe the abusive
                                                    incidents did or did not happen. This is called a ‘Fact Finding’
                                                    hearing.</li>
                                                <li>The court should only order contact between your children and your
                                                    ex if they are satisfied that you or your children will not be
                                                    exposed to the risk of harm.</li>

                                                    complex and take a long time. It is a good idea to find a solicitor
                                                    to manage your case. Try to find one who not only specialises in
                                                    family law, but also has experience of domestic abuse cases. Lawyers

                                                    there is a legal requirement to attend mediation. However if you are
                                                    a victim of abuse, your solicitor should apply for an exemption.
                                                    Make sure your solicitor is aware of this. Entering into mediation

                                                    enforce the order or vary (change) it. The court has a number of
                                                    options to enforce it – they might impose community service, a fine

                                                <li>There are some provisions you can ask the court to specify in the
                                                    child contact order, which might make you and your children feel
                                                    more comfortable. For example, you could request that a child
                                                    contact centre is used, or that contact is supervised or indirect
                                                    (e.g. by phone). Child contact centres are often staffed by
                                                    volunteers, and usually provide weekly sessions of 1 to 2 hours, at
                                                    weekends, where your ex can spend time with your child in a
                                                    partially supervised setting. Your child cannot be taken out of the
                                                    centre without your consent. You do not have to have any contact
                                                    with your partner/ex-partner as you can hand over and collect your
                                                    child from the contact centre staff. Your solicitor can give you
                                                    more information about these centres and make a referral to a
                                                    contact centre on your behalf. You can also seek support from a
                                                    specialist domestic abuse service, which can advise you around safe

                                                <li>If your ex is threatening to take your child abroad, remember that it is a criminal offence for a father of a child under the age of 16 to take or send that child out of the UK without the mother’s consent. If you are worried that your child may be taken out of the country without your consent you should consult a solicitor as soon as possible. The solicitor might be able to apply for a Prohibited Steps Order preventing your partner from travelling with your child.</li>
                                                <li>If you are not married and your partner is not on the birth certificate, then he is unlikely to have parental responsibility and therefore will not have the legal right to take your children from you, anywhere, or to make any parental decisions in your child’s life.</li>
                                                <li>Even if you are married or your partner is on the birth certificate, he still should not take your children anywhere (including within the UK) without your consent. If you have cause to believe your partner is likely to do this, then you can apply to the family court for an emergency Prohibited Steps Order. There is a good chance you will be able to obtain legal aid for such an order (provided your means are within certain limits, and you have some sort of proof of the domestic abuse) – you can find a family law solicitor who can take this matter further.</li>
                                                <li>If your partner is threatening to take the children from the UK in the next 48 hours, you can call the police who can alert all UK points of departure to try to prevent an abduction. This is called a ‘Port Alert’. This initial remedy will remain live for 28 days and will allow you to seek legal advice. More useful information about port alerts can be found here.</li>
                                                <li>You can also make an application to the High Court for a Port Alert (if the Police have not put one on) and for a Location Order and Passport Order which will enable the police to locate your child and seize their passport. This application can be made out of hours if necessary, by telephoning a duty Judge.</li>
                                                <li>Should an All Ports Warning not prove successful, or if your abuser has already left the country before the warning was put in place, you should get urgent legal advice on the procedure for the child’s return as this varies depending on the country that they have been taken to.</li>

                                                <li>If your ex is already having contact with the children, keep a

                                                    with him, the dates and times of any incidents of abuse, and the

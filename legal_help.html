                <h3>Domestic abuse is against the law.</h3>
                <p>
                    The types of crimes a perpetrator may commit include assault, coercive control, sexual offences,
                    harassment or stalking. You have every right to call the police and report your abuser’s behaviour.
                    If you are in an emergency, call 999. You can also use ‘civil’ laws to protect yourself and your
                    children – for example, by getting a civil order that stops your abuser from contacting you. This
                    doesn’t require police involvement. However, if your abuser breaks a civil order it may be a
                    criminal offence and he could be arrested.<br></br>

                    Below are responses to some common questions around domestic abuse and the law. You can get further
                    information by talking to a solicitor, visiting websites run by lawyers, such as Rights of Women or
                    by calling Refuge on the National Domestic Abuse Helpline, 24-hours a day, for free and in
                    confidence, on 0808 2000 247.</b><br></br>

                                            <p>If you want to report your abuser to the police, or if the police have
                                                been called and your perpetrator is arrested, it is important to
                                                consider the following:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    Seek support from a domestic abuse worker. This might be an ‘IDVA’
                                                    (independent domestic violence advocate) or an outreach worker who
                                                    can support you. They can explain the criminal justice process,
                                                    support you through any interviews, liaise with the police and
                                                    courts on your behalf, and advocate for ‘special measures’ (e.g. a
                                                    screen and separate entrances so that you don’t have to see your
                                                    abuser) if the case goes to court, or anything else you may need.
                                                    The police may refer you to a service. You can also ‘self-refer’.
                                                    Find services online, or call the Helpline for a referral. Before
                                                    you look for services online, consider whether your partner might be
                                                    tracking how you use the internet.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    You have a right to be kept informed of how the case is progressing.
                                                    If your perpetrator is arrested, it is important that you know if
                                                    and when he is being released. The police should give you a crime
                                                    reference number and they should contact you. However, if you don’t
                                                    hear from the police, you can call and ask. A domestic abuse support
                                                    worker can help you with this.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    f you know your perpetrator is going to be released, it is important
                                                    to consider your safety and the safety of any children. The police
                                                    may release him ‘on bail’ which may or may not have conditions
                                                    attached (such as a condition not to contact you). If you are not
                                                    sure whether any conditions are in place, ask the police or ask your
                                                    domestic abuse support worker to find out. If the police have not
                                                    issued any bail conditions, ask your support worker to contact the
                                                    police to see if these can be put in place.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    If there are no bail conditions, or you feel your abuser is unlikely
                                                    to stick to any conditions imposed on him and he knows where you
                                                    are, you may want to consider fleeing to a safe place like a refuge.
                                                    If you have a domestic abuse worker, seek support from her – if you
                                                    don’t, call Refuge on the National Domestic Abuse Helpline.

                                                <li>
                                                    Another option is to apply for a Non-Molestation Order (NMO) with
                                                    the help of a solicitor. You can also consider applying for a NMO on
                                                    your own (see below) – speak to a domestic abuse worker about your
                                                    options.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    Another option is to ask the police about getting a Domestic
                                                    Violence Protection Notice (DVPN). You could do this yourself, or
                                                    ask a domestic abuse support worker to ask on your behalf. This is a
                                                    notice given to the abuser by the police to provide emergency
                                                    protection to a victim of domestic violence. The notice contains
                                                    conditions such as barring the abuser from returning to your home or
                                                    otherwise contacting you. Within 48 hours of the DVPN being issued,
                                                    the police must submit an application to the magistrates’ court for
                                                    a ‘DVPO’ – Domestic Violence Protection Order – which will extend
                                                    the terms of the DVPN for up to 28 days. Police sometimes put these
                                                    notices in place without a woman asking.

                                        <h3>How does the criminal justice process work?</h3>
                                        <div class="faq-content">
                                            <p>If your abuser has committed a crime, the police should investigate the
                                                case and pass their evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The
                                                CPS will decide if there is enough evidence to charge the abuser with a
                                                criminal offence. If so, the abuser must attend the Magistrates Court to
                                                hear the case against him.<br></br>

                                                For many criminal offences, the abuser will have a choice to have his
                                                case heard in the Magistrates Court or to attend the Crown Court for
                                                trial by jury. However, for some criminal offences such as common
                                                assault, the abuser can only be dealt with by the Magistrates
                                                Court.<br></br>

                                                At the end of the criminal trial, whether the abuser is found guilty or
                                                not guilty, the CPS may request a ‘restraining order’ order from the
                                                judge. This is a court order that will prohibit him from certain future
                                                behaviours such as threatening or contacting you, or visiting specific
                                                places such as your home or work. It is up to the judge whether to grant
                                                such an order. However, it is helpful to make sure that the police/CPS
                                                is specifically asking the judge to impose such an order.<br></br>

                                                If the abuser breaks a restraining order, this is a serious criminal
                                                offence punishable by up to five years prison.<br></br>

                                            <p>There are two main types of civil orders for women experiencing domestic
                                                abuse. Non-molestation orders can prevent your abuser from using or
                                                threatening violence, intimidating, harassing, or pestering you. An
                                                occupation order can exclude your abuser from the home you share;
                                                sometimes your abuser will have to continue to pay the rent or mortgage.
                                                You can get both orders at the same time if needed. Occupation Orders
                                                can be difficult to obtain and generally a ‘high level’ of domestic
                                                abuse is required.<br></br>

                                                Civil orders are granted by the civil court (sometimes call the county
                                                court, or family court, as opposed to the criminal court). However, if
                                                your abuser breaks a Non-Molestation Order (but not an Occupation Order)
                                                he may be arrested and charged with a criminal offence.<br></br>

                                                You can apply for civil orders yourself, but it is better to have
                                                support from a solicitor and a specialist domestic abuse support worker.

                                                You may be able to obtain legal aid through a family law solicitor to
                                                apply for these orders. Even if you have higher amounts of income, legal
                                                aid should still be available as the Legal Aid Authority usually waives

                                                be able to get legal aid if you can’t sell your home or the perpetrator
                                                won’t agree to sell it. If you can’t find a legal aid solicitor or
                                                you’ve been told you’re not eligible for legal aid, here are steps to

                                                    The form will ask if you want to apply for a non-molestation order
                                                    and/or an occupation order. It will also ask for your details, your
                                                    abuser’s details, and your relationship to them. It will ask for
                                                    details of what you want, for example, the places you don’t want

                                                    If your abuser does not know where you live or how to contact you,
                                                    leave the space where it asks for your contact details blank. Your

                                                    important that he doesn’t find out where you are. You will need to
                                                    fill out a separate form, called a C8 form, so the court has your
                                                    details but your abuser can’t access them.

                                                    The form will also ask you to ‘give details in support of your
                                                    application’. This is a separate statement where you can write about
                                                    the history of your abuse; you can attach any evidence you have
                                                    (such as print outs of abusive messages, supporting letters from
                                                    professionals, photos of injuries) to the application.

                                                    Once you have filled out the court form and written your statement,
                                                    you will have to go to your local family or county court to apply
                                                    for the order(s). Making an application is free. You can apply for
                                                    these orders on an emergency basis by simply turning up at the
                                                    court. You can give your forms to the administrative desk, sign and
                                                    swear that your statement is true and then wait for a duty judge to
                                                    be free to hear the case.

                                                    You then need to go before the judge for a short time and may be
                                                    asked
                                                    questions about your application. If the judge agrees that they will
                                                    grant the order, it is likely that an interim (or ‘emergency’)

                                                    be asked to return to the court for a second hearing.

                                                by a fine or up to five years in prison. You can call the police
                                                immediately and he may be arrested. If your abuser breaks the Occupation

                                                It is important to let the police know the civil order is in place, as
                                                they may be able to ‘flag’ your property and respond quicker. You can do
                                                this by calling 101 and asking to speak to the police team that

                                                Unfortunately, a civil order is no guarantee of safety. It is important

                                                Divorce is another form of civil law. Divorce cases are started by
                                                filing a divorce petition with the family court or your local Divorce
                                                Centre. You can also now start a divorce case online. On average it
                                                takes 1-2 years for a divorce to be finalised. There is only one basic
                                                ground for divorce: the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.
                                                ‘Irretrievable breakdown’ is proved by establishing one or more of five
                                                ‘facts’ for divorce:

                                            <h6> ‘Sarah’s Law ’ (The Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme)</h6>
                                            <p>
                                                The Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (DVDS) is often called ‘Sarah’s Law ’. Sarah’s Law  gives a person in a relationship the ‘Right to Ask’
                                                the police if their partner may pose a risk of harm to them. Under
                                                Sarah’s Law , a member of the public can also make enquiries into the
                                                partner of a close friend or family member. If disclosure is deemed
                                                necessary, the information is given to the person at risk, not to the
                                                applicant. Trained police officers and advisers can then provide support
                                                to victims. Under Sarah’s Law , the police can also decide to disclose
                                                information to someone, independently of whether they have asked the
                                                police for information. This is called ‘Right to Know’.
                                                Criminal Injuries Compensation<br></br>

                                                If you receive a physical or mental injury from a physical attack such
                                                as assault, consider applying for compensation from the Criminal
                                                Injuries Compensation Authority (‘CICA’).<br></br>

                                                If you have been the victim of a sexual offence such as sexual assault
                                                or rape, it is not necessary to prove a mental or physical injury to get
                                                compensation because the experience of these crimes is automatically
                                                seen as an injury. You will probably be eligible to receive a set award
                                                depending on the type of sexual offence you have experienced.<br></br>

                                                In order to be eligible for compensation, you must report the incident
                                                to the police as soon as reasonably practicable and within two years of
                                                the date of the incident. It does not matter whether or not the
                                                perpetrator is subsequently arrested or convicted. You also must be
                                                considered ‘ordinarily resident’ in the UK to make the claim or have
                                                been identified as a victim of trafficking. If you were under 18 years
                                                old at the time of the incident, then you need to apply for compensation
                                                within two years of having reported it to the police.<br></br>

                                                You can make your own application for compensation. Organisations who
                                                may be able to assist you with this are Victim Support, Citizens Advice
                                                Bureau and DV survivors. DV survivors will take your application for a claim forward with a supportive legal team<br></br>

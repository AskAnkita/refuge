                <p>
                    The types of crimes a perpetrator may commit include assault, coercive control, sexual offences,
                    harassment or stalking. You have every right to call the police and report your abuser’s behaviour.
                    If you are in an emergency, call 999. You can also use ‘civil’ laws to protect yourself and your
                    children – for example, by getting a civil order that stops your abuser from contacting you. This
                    doesn’t require police involvement. However, if your abuser breaks a civil order it may be a
                    criminal offence and he could be arrested.<br></br>

                    Below are responses to some common questions around domestic abuse and the law. You can get further
                    information by talking to a solicitor, visiting websites run by lawyers, such as Rights of Women or
                    by calling Refuge on the National Domestic Abuse Helpline, 24-hours a day, for free and in

                                            <p>If you want to report your abuser to the police, or if the police have
                                                been called and your perpetrator is arrested, it is important to
                                                consider the following:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    Seek support from a domestic abuse worker. This might be an ‘IDVA’
                                                    (independent domestic violence advocate) or an outreach worker who
                                                    can support you. They can explain the criminal justice process,
                                                    support you through any interviews, liaise with the police and
                                                    courts on your behalf, and advocate for ‘special measures’ (e.g. a
                                                    screen and separate entrances so that you don’t have to see your
                                                    abuser) if the case goes to court, or anything else you may need.
                                                    The police may refer you to a service. You can also ‘self-refer’.
                                                    Find services online, or call the Helpline for a referral. Before
                                                    you look for services online, consider whether your partner might be
                                                    tracking how you use the internet.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    You have a right to be kept informed of how the case is progressing.
                                                    If your perpetrator is arrested, it is important that you know if
                                                    and when he is being released. The police should give you a crime
                                                    reference number and they should contact you. However, if you don’t
                                                    hear from the police, you can call and ask. A domestic abuse support
                                                    worker can help you with this.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    f you know your perpetrator is going to be released, it is important
                                                    to consider your safety and the safety of any children. The police
                                                    may release him ‘on bail’ which may or may not have conditions
                                                    attached (such as a condition not to contact you). If you are not
                                                    sure whether any conditions are in place, ask the police or ask your
                                                    domestic abuse support worker to find out. If the police have not
                                                    issued any bail conditions, ask your support worker to contact the
                                                    police to see if these can be put in place.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    If there are no bail conditions, or you feel your abuser is unlikely
                                                    to stick to any conditions imposed on him and he knows where you
                                                    are, you may want to consider fleeing to a safe place like a refuge.
                                                    If you have a domestic abuse worker, seek support from her – if you
                                                    don’t, call Refuge on the National Domestic Abuse Helpline.

                                                <li>
                                                    Another option is to apply for a Non-Molestation Order (NMO) with
                                                    the help of a solicitor. You can also consider applying for a NMO on
                                                    your own (see below) – speak to a domestic abuse worker about your
                                                    options.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    Another option is to ask the police about getting a Domestic
                                                    Violence Protection Notice (DVPN). You could do this yourself, or
                                                    ask a domestic abuse support worker to ask on your behalf. This is a
                                                    notice given to the abuser by the police to provide emergency
                                                    protection to a victim of domestic violence. The notice contains
                                                    conditions such as barring the abuser from returning to your home or
                                                    otherwise contacting you. Within 48 hours of the DVPN being issued,
                                                    the police must submit an application to the magistrates’ court for
                                                    a ‘DVPO’ – Domestic Violence Protection Order – which will extend
                                                    the terms of the DVPN for up to 28 days. Police sometimes put these
                                                    notices in place without a woman asking.

                                        <h3>How does the criminal justice process work?</h3>
                                        <div class="faq-content">
                                            <p>If your abuser has committed a crime, the police should investigate the
                                                case and pass their evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The
                                                CPS will decide if there is enough evidence to charge the abuser with a
                                                criminal offence. If so, the abuser must attend the Magistrates Court to
                                                hear the case against him.<br></br>

                                                For many criminal offences, the abuser will have a choice to have his
                                                case heard in the Magistrates Court or to attend the Crown Court for
                                                trial by jury. However, for some criminal offences such as common
                                                assault, the abuser can only be dealt with by the Magistrates
                                                Court.<br></br>

                                                At the end of the criminal trial, whether the abuser is found guilty or
                                                not guilty, the CPS may request a ‘restraining order’ order from the
                                                judge. This is a court order that will prohibit him from certain future
                                                behaviours such as threatening or contacting you, or visiting specific
                                                places such as your home or work. It is up to the judge whether to grant
                                                such an order. However, it is helpful to make sure that the police/CPS
                                                is specifically asking the judge to impose such an order.<br></br>

                                                If the abuser breaks a restraining order, this is a serious criminal
                                                offence punishable by up to five years prison.<br></br>

                                        <h3>I don't want the police involved right now. How can civil law protect me?
                                        </h3>

                                            <p>There are two main types of civil orders for women experiencing domestic
                                                abuse. Non-molestation orders can prevent your abuser from using or
                                                threatening violence, intimidating, harassing, or pestering you. An
                                                occupation order can exclude your abuser from the home you share;
                                                sometimes your abuser will have to continue to pay the rent or mortgage.
                                                You can get both orders at the same time if needed. Occupation Orders
                                                can be difficult to obtain and generally a ‘high level’ of domestic
                                                abuse is required.<br></br>

                                                Civil orders are granted by the civil court (sometimes call the county
                                                court, or family court, as opposed to the criminal court). However, if
                                                your abuser breaks a Non-Molestation Order (but not an Occupation Order)
                                                he may be arrested and charged with a criminal offence.<br></br>

                                                You can apply for civil orders yourself, but it is better to have
                                                support from a solicitor and a specialist domestic abuse support worker.

                                                You may be able to obtain legal aid through a family law solicitor to
                                                apply for these orders. Even if you have higher amounts of income, legal
                                                aid should still be available as the Legal Aid Authority usually waives
                                                the means test. Or if you own a home with the perpetrator, you may still
                                                be able to get legal aid if you can’t sell your home or the perpetrator
                                                won’t agree to sell it. If you can’t find a legal aid solicitor or
                                                you’ve been told you’re not eligible for legal aid, here are steps to
                                                apply for the order yourself:<br></br>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    Find your local court. You can either download, print and fill-in
                                                    the forms before you go, or collect the forms from the court when
                                                    you arrive. You can download the form here. If you think your
                                                    partner is tracking your internet activities, use a computer he does
                                                    not have access to or pick up the form in person.

                                                <li>
                                                    The form will ask if you want to apply for a non-molestation order
                                                    and/or an occupation order. It will also ask for your details, your
                                                    abuser’s details, and your relationship to them. It will ask for
                                                    details of what you want, for example, the places you don’t want
                                                    your abuser to be allowed to go to. If you are applying for an
                                                    occupation order, you will have to answer questions about who owns
                                                    your home, or who is on the tenancy agreement. But note that you
                                                    don’t have to be a home owner or a tenant to apply for an order. You

                                                    If your abuser does not know where you live or how to contact you,
                                                    leave the space where it asks for your contact details blank. Your
                                                    perpetrator will be ‘served’ with a copy of the order, so it is
                                                    important that he doesn’t find out where you are. You will need to
                                                    fill out a separate form, called a C8 form, so the court has your
                                                    details but your abuser can’t access them.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    The form will also ask you to ‘give details in support of your
                                                    application’. This is a separate statement where you can write about
                                                    the history of your abuse; you can attach any evidence you have
                                                    (such as print outs of abusive messages, supporting letters from
                                                    professionals, photos of injuries) to the application.

                                                <li>
                                                    Once you have filled out the court form and written your statement,
                                                    you will have to go to your local family or county court to apply
                                                    for the order(s). Making an application is free. You can apply for
                                                    these orders on an emergency basis by simply turning up at the
                                                    court. You can give your forms to the administrative desk, sign and
                                                    swear that your statement is true and then wait for a duty judge to
                                                    be free to hear the case.
